# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user authentication system for the application, providing secure user registration, login, and session management capabilities. The system will handle user account creation with proper validation, secure authentication flows, and maintain user sessions across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account with my name, email, and password, so that I can access the application's features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the registration form THEN the system SHALL validate that the name is at least 3 characters long
2. WHEN a user submits the registration form THEN the system SHALL validate that the email field is not empty and follows a valid email format
3. WHEN a user submits the registration form THEN the system SHALL validate that the password field is not empty
4. WHEN a user submits the registration form THEN the system SHALL validate that the password confirmation matches the password
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages for each validation failure
6. WHEN all validation passes THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and store it securely
7. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to a success page or automatically log them in

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access my account and the application's protected features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the login form THEN the system SHALL validate that the email field is not empty
2. WHEN a user submits the login form THEN the system SHALL validate that the password field is not empty
3. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and create a session
4. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message without revealing whether the email or password was incorrect
5. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to their intended destination or a default dashboard
6. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry without clearing the email field

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to be maintained across page refreshes and browser tabs, so that I don't have to repeatedly log in during my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session that persists across page refreshes
2. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain their authentication state
3. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser within a reasonable timeframe THEN the system SHALL remember their login status
4. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate their session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear feedback when forms are submitted, so that I understand what's happening and can correct any errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a form THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback that the form is being processed
2. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages clearly associated with the relevant form fields
3. WHEN a form submission is successful THEN the system SHALL provide clear confirmation of the successful action
4. WHEN there are server errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN forms are being processed THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate submissions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to have proper TypeScript types and error handling, so that the code is maintainable and type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing server actions THEN the system SHALL use proper TypeScript types for all parameters and return values
2. WHEN handling form data THEN the system SHALL validate and type all input data appropriately
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with proper error types
4. WHEN components use authentication data THEN the system SHALL provide properly typed interfaces for all shared data structures
5. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
